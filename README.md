# Connect4TheGame
 
The famous "Connect 4" game. Made for the sole purpose to write min-max algorithm for an AI opponent.

Version 1.0 was created in a hurry and without respect or even concideration of good practices.

Main objective of this project is to make the code great again!

# To Do
* Add UML class diagram
* Do some proper code refactorisation
* Add design patterns if necessary
* Add Gui as main UI for the game
* Add runnable interface to the engine to spectate AIvsAI matches.
